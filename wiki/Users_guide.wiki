= Introduction =

Information about DEScribe according to your operating system.


= About DEScribe =
- DEScribe is a new open source java application for Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES). Launched in background, questions (loaded from an XML file form) will be asked to user and answers will be collected in order to export them (to XML file) and send them to an experimenter who will be able to analyze them.<br />

- A set of questions and their answers represents what is here called "session". A session can be created, consulted, exported to XML, paused or closed from the sessions frame.<br />

- DEScribe's question frame allows user to fill a form with questions generated during a session. It can have many questions of different types. At the end user can validate or skip the form (no data saved) by clicking on the frame's bottom buttons.
